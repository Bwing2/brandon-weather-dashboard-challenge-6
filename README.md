[Live deploy link](https://bwing2.github.io/brandon-weather-dashboard-challenge-6/)

## Description

As a developer, it is important to be able to use API's to call and recieve information in the form on requests and responses. This project challenged me to fully understanding a third party API, and be able to display important information that was relevant to the task. I tried to manipulate the DOM as much as I could in JavaScript, and to not use jQuery as an extra challenge for myself.The hardest part was figuring out how to use local storage so that the buttons in my search history linked back to the previous cities. I learned a lot about the importance of reading documentation for third party API's, and have gotten more comfortable with local storage and DOM manipulation.

## Installation

1. Go to repository main page.
2. Click the green `<> Code` button.
3. Click the SSH button under the Clone heading, and copy the link.
4. Open the terminal.
5. `cd` into the location you want the file to be stored.
6. type `git clone`, and then paste the URL that was copied.
7. Press enter, and you should see a message containing "Cloning into 'directory name'...",meaning you are successful.
8. Open VS Code using `code .` and the copied repository should be there.
